# Cosmos Data Migrator

Simple console app that can be used to transfer data between Cosmos accounts.

To run the application, you'll first need to populate the source and destination connection strings in appsettings.json, or in a user secrets file, see the documentation available on this [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=windows#enable-secret-storage).

These connection strings are available under the **Keys** section of your Cosmos account.
